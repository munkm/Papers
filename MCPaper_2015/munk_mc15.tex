The \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} radiometric dating technique is an attractive option for future martian age-dating applications. However, in-situ \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} radiometric dating on Mars presents unique challenges to the design of a device capable of achieving sufficient precision on geological samples obtained on the Martian surface. For this application, a fast neutron source with a low thermal neutron flux is ideal for inducing the \ce{^{39}K}(n,p)\ce{^{39}Ar} reaction with few competing reactions that require age-correction factors. This paper explores the design of a neutron emitting device specifically for in-situ geochronological applications on Mars. We have determined that the most feasible design is likely a \ce{^{252}Cf} spontaneous fission source shielded with layered polyethylene and a strong thermal neutron absorber. Although boosting options--induced fission sources, ($\alpha$,n)--are available, they do not provide sufficient neutron multiplicity to justify the increased mass of the device. Furthermore, shielding the rover from the neutron source will likely comprise the largest fractional mass of the device, which will be reduced by shielding only a fractional solid angle of the source. While we have determined that it is possible to design such a neutron source, there will also be other instrumentation competing for a mass fraction of the Rover instrument payload. The addition of this instrumentation may make it difficult to design a device that achieves the required mass and fluence limitations for a future mission.

\section{Introduction}

One of the goals of the future rover missions includes determining the age of Mars. Current efforts on this front have been focused on using the \ce{^{40}K}/\ce{^{40}Ar} method (henceforth referred to as the K/Ar method) \cite{farley_situ_2014,farley_double-spike_2013,cassata_situ_2014}. This method relies upon the fact that \ce{^{40}K} decays to \ce{^{40}Ar}. Assuming that at the time of formation there is no argon in the sample (a good assumption, as the gas thermodynamically driven to diffuse out of the molten rock), an age can be calculated with this parent-daughter ratio \cite{mcdougall_geochronology_1999}. This method is not without its drawbacks. To count the relative abundances of \ce{^{40}K} and \ce{^{40}Ar}, separate processes are required to isolate each element, so two samples are required. Additionally, the abundance counts for each element are an average across each grain forming the macroscopic rock structure. Should some high temperature event occur after formation, migration of the \ce{^{40}Ar} near the grain boundaries can be driven from the rock by temperature-enhanced diffusion. This premature loss of \ce{^{40}Ar} in the sample would skew the parent-daughter age determined from the K/Ar method, thus resulting in an unreliable and random age. If the rock is heated to a temperature high enough to liberate all of the accrued radiogenic \ce{^{40}Ar}, the calculated K/Ar age will be that of the thermal event, not the formation age. \\

An alternative approach to the \ce{^{40}K}/\ce{^{40}Ar} method is the \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} method [REFERENCE]. This approach uses

Need to briefly describe ar-ar  method before you talk about why it's attractive.

The \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} method for evaluating the age of geological samples is attractive for a number of reasons: (1) it reveals information about the thermal history of the sample, (2) potassium is readily abundant in much of the Martian surface, so acceptable counting statistics are achievable on many potential samples, and (3) it is a well-understood method with a large experience base. 

The remainder of this paper will discuss ... Section \ref{sec:design} covers the details of the device design. The feasibility of device configurations is discussed in Section \ref{sec:feasibility}, and future work in Section \ref{sec:future}. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

A neutron emitting device that is optimized for in-situ irradiation and geochronological analysis will have a number of components. For the irradiation, a source producing a sufficiently high fast neutron flux

Complete device designs were simulated with MCNP5~\cite{brown_mcnp_2002}. Several geometries were considered (Fig.\ \ref{fig:geometries}).

The authors did not consider compact fusion sources, which have been considered for terrestrial \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} geochronology \cite{renne_application_2005}, as they are not mass-feasible for this application. Furthermore, we did not consider critical configurations of the device, as the device will be irradiating the sample for hundreds of days at a time and a system to compensate for reactivity feedback and other physical effects will add unnecessary complexity to an already inflexible design criteria. Transition sentence introducing the remainder of the section.


\subsection{Neutron Source}

A number of neutron source options were considered. Isotopes decaying by some probability of spontaneous fission offer a predictable neutron source flux with a sufficiently high quantity of fast neutrons. However, these sources also decay over time, so sample irradiation times will increase over the lifetime of the device to achieve the same fluence. Passive capture sources, like ($\alpha$,n) reactions, are attractive because two elements are required to create neutrons. This could mean source strength could be user-controlled, prolonging the life of the neutron source and, consequently, the entire device. Boosting material offers similar benefits to the latter and can be chosen to maximize fast neutron creation.  \\

Overall, the neutron source and booster have a few design constraints. First, the source must provide a fluence comparable to that of a terrestrial research reactor in ~200 days or less. This fluence should be achievable throughout the lifetime of the device, meaning that the half-life should not be too short. Second, the neutron energy spectrum should be relatively fast to maximize the \ce{^{39}K}(n,p)\ce{^{39}Ar} reaction and minimize the competing Ar generating reactions. Third, the source should have a relatively low power density, to minimize the heat transferred to the sample chamber. Finally, the source should have a low mass to provide the required neutron supply. Depending on the feasibility of startup and shutdown of this device this 'low mass' could range between <1g or ~30kg. 

\subsubsection{Passive fission sources}


Table \ref{tab:fisssource} compares the total mass and heat output for a number of different spontaneous fission isotopes (SF BR is spontaneous fission branch ratio). This was calculated with existing fission yield data in the literature~\cite{england_evaluation_1995, axton_neutron_1985}.
No isotope seems to completely satisfy all of the requirements of the passive fission sources. Some have long half lives but require significant mass. Others create too much heat and will cause a premature release of natural and radiogenic argon. \ce{^{252}Cf} appears to most closely satisfy the heat output and mass requirements while also having a reasonably long half life. \ce{^{252}Cf} has the added benefit of broad user experience \cite{martin_production_2000} and a slightly faster neutron energy spectrum than that of \ce{^{235}U} \cite{hjalmar_energy_1955}. However, using \ce{^{252}Cf} as the sole neutron source in the device does pose some disadvantages: the device lifetime is unlikely to exceed the lifetime of the Mars rover as several half lives will pass during the course of a Martian mission, and it will take several years in a specialized reactor to produce enough \ce{^{252}Cf} to supply the source requirement desired for these purposes. 

For all MCNP5 simulations a source definition with a watt fission spectrum reflecting \ce{^{252}Cf} was used \cite[Appendix~C]{valentine_mcnp-dsp_1997}.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Passive capture sources}

Passive capture sources \cite{weise_neutron_1984,jacobs_energy_1983,marsh_high_1995} are those that generate neutrons by some capture reaction (excluding neutron capture, which is detailed in a subsequent section). Originally, these sources were attractive because separation of the element emitting the incident particle from the target would cease neutron production. % I am unsure about what this sentence means?
 The ability to "shut down" the neutron source would reduce the required neutron shielding for the Mars rover (assuming dose limits are fluence rather than dose rate dependent) and only require that the rover is constantly shielded from $\alpha$ particles.  Additionally, the neutron energy spectrum from this reaction is relatively fast. %However, these sources require homogenized mixing to supply the neutron flux defined previously.
However, the total neutron production is on the order of a few  neutrons per $10^6\:\alpha$ particles per second or less for most materials \cite{weise_neutron_1984,jacobs_energy_1983}. Consequently, for a $10^{11}$ neutron/s source, a roughly $10^{17}$ $\alpha$/s source would be required. 
% Why do we care about alphas? It seems like you're trying to argue that you would need too much mass - I think the alphas are distracting and you should talk more concretely about mass and half life. 
This is substantially more than the current $\alpha$ particle source rate from the RTG on Curiosity. Despite considering passive capture sources for in-situ \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} geochronology on lunar missions \cite{li_evaluation_2011}, a martian mission has significantly tighter mass and volume limitations. Therefore, while it is possible to obtain an alpha source that is large enough from an emission standpoint, the neutron source would either be of significant mass, which will violate mission limits, or with a short half-life, which will not meet time requirements.

\subsubsection{Boosting material}

The boosting material considered loosely falls into two categories: induced fission neutron sources, and neutron capture neutron sources. Both of these sources require an additional driving neutron source to produce neutrons. Induced fission sources can offer substantial multiplicitave boosting if the device configuration is near critical.  Much of the previous work on determining the minimum critical mass of induced-fission sources  was done with homogenized layers of fissionable material and moderator to enhance thermally-induced fission neutrons \cite{karni_semi-automated_keff,karni_smores_2003,goluoglu_smoresnew_2002}. This is not an attractive option for this application since a large fraction of the neutron flux will be thermal and thus unusable for the \ce{^{39}K}(n,p)\ce{^{39}Ar} reaction. Of the induced fission sources, blah blah blah were considered, as illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:boosters}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{Boosters.png}
  \caption{Induced fission neutron boosters}
  \label{fig:boosters}
\end{figure}

Of the neutron capture sources, the most attractive appeared to be the (n,2n) and (n,3n) fast neutron reactions in beryllium metal. A variant of Fig.\ \ref{fig:geometries} (?) was simulated with MCNP5, with a \ce{^{252}Cf} point source surrounded by a spherical shell of \ce{^{9}Be} metal, shielded with a premadex, hydrogenous material enriched in \ce{^{6}Li}, shell (does that need a citation?).
% I'm not exactly sure what you're asking needs a citation. The geometries figure was produced Leah, but should I refer to the corporate website for Premadex? 
To find the best design, the thickness of the \ce{^{9}Be} shell was varied; Fig.\ \ref{fig:beboosters} summarizes these results. As the thickness of \ce{^{9}Be} increases so does the flux boost, peaking at a $\sim$10\% boost with an 8.5cm shell around the point source. Although this boost is not negligible, it is not worth the added mass of $\sim$5.6kg, which would only offset a short increment of \ce{^{252}Cf} decay losses. The beryllium may at first seem attractive as an ($\alpha$,n) source but this reaction contributes several orders of magnitude fewer neutrons than competing neutron reactions in the same material. As such, the contribution of ($\alpha$,n) neutrons from beryllium are negligible in this case. 
%but the flux boost from this reaction is several orders of magnitude less than the boosting from the (n,2n) and (n,3n) reactions, so it is not included.  
% I don't think you need the last sentence - if you want to keep it in reword since it's a little confusing

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{Be_boost.png}
  \caption{Boosting the neutron flux with beryllium}
  \label{fig:beboosters}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Neutron Shield Design}

The most basic shield design is surrounding a point source of neutrons with a \ce{^{252}Cf} energy spectrum with a spherical shell of shield material. Figure \ref{fig:basics} illustrates the reduction in source strength as a function of radial distance away from the point source for a number of shield material options. (say what the materials you use are; I have no idea what the things in the legend are). %I'm updating these material names in my figure. It will look better soon
The hydrogenous materials perform far better than the thermal neutron-absorbing metals, which is expected since without low atomic mass materials there is no moderator to slow neutrons to thermal energies where they will be absorbed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{Basics.png}
  \caption{Performance comparison for various shield material options}
  \label{fig:basics}
\end{figure}

Based on these observations, a composite shield designed to moderate and then absorb neutrons is likely the best option to reduce the radial thickness of required shield material. First the fast fission neutrons from the \ce{^{252}Cf} source must be moderated by a low atomic mass material. At the point in the moderating material at which there is no increase in thermal neutrons for an increase in moderator thickness, a foil of a strong thermal neutron absorber can be used to The idea is that the fission spectrum of \ce{^{252}Cf} should be moderated with a lighter atomic mass material, and then a thin foil of Cd or Gd, which absorb thermal neutrons effectively, would be used to remove the peak thermal neutron flux. 
% These two sets of thoughts aren't clearly connected. You need to relate the materials and the thicknesses to the design you're suggesting, and then end the paragraph with a concluding sentence.

For polyethylene, Fig.\ \ref{fig:polychar} indicates that the maximum thermal neutron flux fraction occurs $\sim$15-20 cm away from the point source. For premadex, this location is at $\sim$12-15 cm (Fig.\ \ref{fig:premchar}). However, the polyethylene has a much greater specific linear scattering efficiency, so foil placement could still be effective if placed before the peak thermal flux.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Considerations}

A device optimized for the in-situ irradiation and age determination of geological samples requires an instrument payload in addition to the neutron emitting device. This will include, but is not limited to: a drilling mechanism, a mass spectrometer, and a system with which to heat up the sample to perform step-heating. Including these components' contributions to the overall device mass will place an even greater limit on the neutron source and shielding masses. A more detailed consideration of each of these components and their mass will be published in a forthcoming publication. For the purposes of this paper, the device including only the neutron source/booster and shielding contributed to the total device mass. 

While the bulk of this paper is dedicated to the analysis and design of a neutron source that can produce an acceptable fluence on reasonable timescales, the device designed for geochronological applications will include an additional instrument payload. These instruments, such as a mass spectrometer, can be optimized to have a greater abundance sensitivity. This could offset the loss of precision from a lower flux neutron source, but will undoubtedly come at a greater mass expense. Prioritizing which of these is more important will be imperative in moving forward with future designs. The total mass threshold could be increased if the RTG on the rover could be replaced with the neutron device. This would require a much more sophisticated heat removal and power conversion system than we have proposed for the device described in this paper. Furthermore, the need of a small neutron emitting device could be avoided if other space reactor concepts are considered for future missions to Mars. In this case, a system not unlike the setup at the Oregon State TRIGA reactor could be designed for sample irradiation.

The shield analyzed in the aformentioned sections did not consider activation effects or bubble formation from long-term neutron exposure to the shield. Both of these effects could augment the effectiveness of the shield over time. In particular, foils in the composite shield may lose effectiveness early on in the mission due to its high absorption cross section. The foils would then supply more radiation damage to the rover--from activation product produced photons--than protection, invalidating its use as a shield.

\section{Feasibility of Device Configurations}
\label{sec:feasibility}

Future, unmanned missions to Mars or other extra-terrestrial surfaces Using the current instrument payload on Curiosity as an approximation for the mass limitation of the neutron device

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
% If you end up being tight on space, you can cut down this section to just briefly say that you need to consider other things. You could make it just one paragraph in conclusions.
Thus far, the neutronic feasibility of this device design has been explored. However, a number of other considerations must also be accounted for in greater detail in future analyses. Heat transfer calculations should be performed to ensure that the sample temperature will not exceed 200\celsius, which would lead to premature release of trapped argon in the sample. This calculation is contingent upon concrete knowledge of the design materials and geometry, and could be performed with some finite element heat transfer package. 

Furthermore, selecting a power source to provide sufficient energy with which to step heat the sample to acceptable temperatures will be important since both \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} and \ce{^{40}K}/\ce{^{40}Ar} age calculations may be skewed without adequate heating. The most recent K/Ar age sample from Mars was heated to 890\celsius \cite{farley_situ_2014}, which does not reach the temperatures usually required for complete sample step heating, $\sim$1200\celsius \cite{mcdougall_geochronology_1999}. Powering a device to heat the sample to this temperature may temporarily disable the rover or even exceed current design limitations. 

The shielding analysis and optimization detailed in this paper was exclusively for neutron shielding. Future rovers will also have photon dose limits, which will require shielding to ensure that the electronics do not degrade at an unacceptable rate. The addition of thermal neutron absorbers in a composite shield option, like Cd or Gd, will produce high energy photons that may have adverse effects on the overall damage rate of the device. 
Further optimization to minimize shield mass and volume more explicitly will be beneficial. Should fissionable booster options be considered, it would also be ideal to minimize the boosting material mass to achieve the desired subcritical multiplication factor. %Existing software to determine the minimize critical mass \cite{goluoglu_smoresnew_2002,karni_semi-automated_keff,karni_smores_2003} of systems and optimize shield designs \cite{greenspan_material_1994,greenspan_swans:_2001} are available in the SCALE package \cite{bowman_scale_2003}. Using this software in future design iterations would aid in the convergence to a realistic device design.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

A compact neutron source is an attractive candidate to induce the necessary reactions for  \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar}  geochronological applications on future, unmanned, missions to extra-terrestrial bodies where sample return is neither feasible nor likely. However, the vast range of overall dose and dose rate limits for existing  rover designs lead to ambiguity in shielding designs, making optimization difficult. Furthermore, the longevity of the neutron source is likely to be compromised with the  exclusive use of a \ce{^{252}Cf} fission neutron source. The lifetime could be extended with boosting material, but that would require moderation of all 4$\pi$ solid angles of the boosting material to achieve increased efficiency in neutron-induced fission. The addition of both shielding material and enough boosting material to achieve a high enough effective multiplication factor renders this configuration likely unfeasible.
