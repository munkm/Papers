Problems to run:
- rerun quadrature order problems
- rerun PN order problems

Even Better:
- do mesh refinement study to determine best result for lowest cost on each of
  the problems
- 

Broader things we need:
- Table for each problem of FOMs and REs
- Plot for each problem comparing analog, (FW)CADIS, (FW)CADIS-omega
- Comparison plot of different quadrature types and orders for each method
-
