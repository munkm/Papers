\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sect::intro}

Efficiently modeling radiation transport in deep penetration shielding problems is essential to the safe operation of many types of nuclear facilities as well as the development of monitoring and detection systems. We would like to be able to perform such calculations with Monte Carlo (MC) methods, but it can be quite challenging to obtain acceptable statistical uncertainties in the computed tallies. Thus, many variance reduction (VR) strategies, some of which we will discuss, have been developed to facilitate accurate calculations in reasonable times. 

Problems that exhibit a strong degree of angular anisotropy in particle flux, however, tend to be even more challenging for effective VR.
Many existing VR methods do not include angular information in their techniques, and therefore do not work well for these problems.  
Some VR methods do include angular information, but in general these methods have challenges in breadth of applicability or ease of use that make them inadequate as broad tools, or are too costly to use reliably in practice.

With the goal of filling some of these gaps, we have developed a new method that builds on the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) and Forward Weighted-CADIS (FW-CADIS) methods~\cite{wagner_forward-weighted_2007} to tackle fixed-source problems that exhibit a high degree of angular anisotropy. 
This method builds on existing software infrastructure in a way that facilitates easy adoption.
CADIS and FW-CADIS, which we will jointly refer to FW/CADIS, use scalar flux estimates from a deterministic calcualtion to create VR parameters for use in MC.
Our new method uses a forward-weighted adjoint scalar flux based on a normalized contributon flux instead of a standard scalar flux.
This new integration scheme includes angular information in order to improve MC performance for problems with anisotropic particle fluxes.

We have implemented this method and tested it on an optically-thick source-detector labyrinth demonstration problem. 
This demonstration problem has characteristics that are particularly challenging for existing methods and provides an opportunity to deeply investigate differences between this new method and CADIS.
As such, we compare an analog calculation, a standard CADIS calculation, and a new angular CADIS calculation, henceforth referred to as CADIS-$\Omega$, which shows that [Talk about the results that we have here]. 

In this paper, we begin with a brief background (Section~\ref{sect::second}) of important concepts relating to variance reduction and existing hybrid methods for deep-penetration radiation transport.
We then provide the context of existing methods in Section~\ref{sect::past}. 
Section~\ref{sect::methodology} describes the mathematical foundation of our proposed method (Section~\ref{subsect::theory}) and the software that we used to implement it (Section~\ref{subsect::implementation}). 
The results and accompanying discussion are described in Section~\ref{sect::results}. Following this, Section~\ref{sect::future} presents our future test plans and details how this plan will map out the application space beyond this single demonstration test. 
We conclude in Section~\ref{sect::conclusion}.

\section{BACKGROUND}
\label{sect::second}

This section provides the equations we are solving as well as background concepts that are used in many VR methods and ideas needed for our method in particular. 
Many modern radiation transport codes offer variance reduction capabilities that employ an importance map\textemdash a measure of how important a particular particle in a Monte Carlo simulation is to the tally being computed\textemdash which is related to the adjoint form of the transport equation. 
%Using this importance information, the Monte Carlo code can spend more time on important particles and less time on unimportant particles. This reduces the statistical variance in the final tally result for a given amount of computational time, providing better results in less time. 
Our method's algorithm also incorporates a weighted variant of the contributon flux, which 
Our new method also uses contributons, which (words about contributons) ~\cite{williams_contributorn_1992}. 

%Write forward and adjoint importance equation and define terms\\
The steady state, fixed-source forms of the forward and adjoint transport equation are
\begin{align*}
\bigl[\hat{\Omega} \cdot \nabla + \Macro_t(\vec{r}, E)\bigr] \psi(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, E)  =  \int_0^{\infty} dE' &\int_{4\pi} d\hat{\Omega'} \:\Macro_{s}(\vec{r}, E' \to E, \hat{\Omega'} \cdot \hat{\Omega}) \psi(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega'}, E') + q(\vec{r}, \vOmega, E)\\
%
\bigl[-\vOmega \cdot \nabla + \Sigma_t(\rvec, E)\bigr] \psi^{\dagger}(\vec{r}, \vOmega, E) = \int_0^{\infty} dE' &\int_{4\pi} d\vOmega' \: \Sigma_s(\rvec, E \rightarrow E', \vOmega \cdot \vOmega') \psi^{\dagger}(\rvec, \vOmega', E') \\
&+ q^{\dagger}(\vec{r}, \vOmega, E)\:,
\end{align*}
respectively, where $\psi(\vec{r}, \hat{\Omega}, E)$ is the angular neutron flux, $\Sigma_t$ is the total macroscopic cross section, $\Sigma_s$ is the double-differential scattering cross section, $q$ is a fixed source, and superscript $\dagger$ indicates adjoint quantities. 

% explain Adjoint = Importance; point out this is a concept frequently used in variance reduction (some starting language?)\\
The angular adjoint flux can represent a map of how every part of phase space will influence the answer we are looking for.
That is $\psi$ represents how the source particles go forward and affect the rest of the problem space; $\psi^{\dagger}$ represents how the particles from a source come into the solution space and affect the answer. 

explain Contributon = Response; give any context about use of contributons \\

\section{PAST WORK}
\label{sec::past}
Highlight the CADIS method \\
Highlight the FW-CADIS method \\
Talk about what problems CADIS and FW-CADIS succeed in, then talk about where they fall short. \\

Examples of variance reduction using importance maps include the weight window generator/weight window map (WWG) capability in the MCNP Monte Carlo code~\cite{brown_mcnp_2002}, and the FW/CADIS methods. Target weights in weight window maps are the inverse of the importance values for a given point in phase space.

For problems with very strong anisotropies in the particle flux, such as the streaming found near the air vents of an individual cask or in between casks stored in an array pattern, the importance map and biased source developed using the space/energy treatment above may not represent the real importance well enough to sufficiently accelerate the Monte Carlo calculation. Notice that the angular dependence of the importance function is not retained, because otherwise the map would be very large (tens or hundreds of GB) and more costly and complex to use in the Monte Carlo simulation. 

The drawback of this simplification is that, within a given space/energy cell, the map provides the average importance of a particle moving in any direction through the cell—excluding information about how particles move toward the objective. Consider the simple labyrinth example shown in Figure 1. For a source at the left entrance, the dose rate inside and outside of the labyrinth ranges over 12 orders of magnitude. Analog Monte Carlo would have to sample trillions of particles to get a few to the lowest dose regions. The space/energy treatment used in FW-CADIS makes this problem tractable but challenging. For particles near the turns in the labyrinth, the importance of the particles to the exit of the labyrinth vary greatly if they are coming out of a wall pointed toward the exit versus heading into a wall and away from the exit. This distinction is not captured by current hybrid methods. Including angular information in the importance map should significantly improve the Monte Carlo run time. 

Introduce angle-informed and angle-biased methods. \\
Higlight AVATAR + shortcomings \\
Highlight Turner \& Larsen's method + shortcomings\\

To do fast, accurate transport for used fuel monitoring, what is needed is an importance map generated quickly using deterministic methods that captures the impact of angle in the importance information. A variety of strategies for accomplishing this goal have been tried over the years. One such method is the Local Importance Function Transform (LIFT) method [10], which is derived from the zero-variance method and  uses an approximation of the adjoint flux that is piecewise continuous in angle. LIFT only captures linearly anisotropic scattering, which is not enough for our needs and is somewhat difficult to use [11].

More recently, an attempt by Peplow et al. [12] to solve this problem used the maximum entropy distribution [13] to approximate the angular adjoint flux, , and showed improvement in some problems but very little in others. In that work, the angular component of the adjoint flux was approximated as separable and symmetric about the average adjoint current direction. We will refer to this method as simple angular CADIS. Two versions were implemented, one with (limited) directional source biasing and one without. The method without source biasing is effectively the method used by the AVATAR [14] code on a Cartesian mesh and on a tet-mesh in a code by Evans and Wareing [13]. 

In Peplow et al.’s work, the improvement using simple angular CADIS over standard CADIS ranged from a factor of 0.09 to 3.3 over a collection of eight test problems, many of which have characteristics similar to used fuel cask monitoring systems. In all cases, CADIS and simple angular CADIS outperformed analog Monte Carlo. Peplow et al.’s study demonstrated that in many cases in which anisotropies are important, including angular information will improve calculation efficiency. However, these results also showed that the simple angular CADIS implementation is not accurate enough to provide the improvement necessary to be able to efficiently execute the used fuel cask calculations we would like to perform to improve facility monitoring design and operation. We therefore need to develop a better method for capturing the angular information.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{subsect::implementation}

We implemented this new method through the AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion Generator (ADVANTG)~\cite{wagner_automated_2002, mosher_new_2010} software developed at ORNL. 
ADVANTG automates the generation of the importance map and biased source distribution created using either the CADIS or FW-CADIS methods for use in MCNP5~\cite{brown_mcnp_2002}. 
An input file in MCNP syntax is provided by the user in addition to some instructions for running ADVANTG. 
ADVANTG uses this information to generate input file(s) and exectues the discrete ordinates solver Denovo~\cite{evans_denovo:_2010} in adjoint or forward and adjoint mode, as appropriate.
The deterministic calculations can be performed using multiple cores and/or processors (e.g., on multi-core desktop systems and clusters). 
ADVANTG takes Denovo's output, executes the CADIS or FW-CADIS methods, and the final variance reduction parameters are output in a format that can be used with unmodified versions of MCNP. 
The primary objective of the development of ADVANTG has been to reduce both the user effort and the computational time required to obtain accurate and precise tally estimates
across a broad range of challenging transport application areas.

We chose to use ADVANTG for several key reasons. 
The most important is that the implementation is nearly invisible to the user and therefore their experience of using this method will be nearly identical to using CADIS or FW-CADIS.
That is, the user simply adds an additional instruction asking to use the angle informed method and the interface does not change otherwise.
This facilitates easy adoption.
Further, only one MCNP input file is required to compare the new method to FW/CADIS.
Finally, it was simpler to implement the new method through ADVANTG than starting separately as we could take advantage of so much existing infrastructure in the coupling.

The major modifications required to implement this method were to Denovo. 
The angular flux is typically not stored or written as the desired output is typically the scalar flux.
The new method, however, requires the angular flux to create the scalar flux, and therefore Denovo was modified to store and write the angular flux.
A new function was also added that takes the forward and adjoint fluxes and performs the integration indicated in eqn.~\eqref{eq::angularhybrid}. 
This set of scalar fluxes is then written the way any scalar flux output from Denovo would be.

The benefit the bulk of the implementation being in Denovo is several fold. 
From the standpoint of ADVANTG, there are very few differences between the new method and FW/CADIS and therefore implementation is straightforward.
Further, anyone who finds a use for a scalar flux created as in eqn.~\eqref{eq::angularhybrid} will now be able  access it.
Finally, it might be useful to have access to the full angular flux. 
Examining the angular flux for a problem could have research or pedagogical implications, and some other variance reduction method that uses the angular flux explicitly could be more easily developed in the future.

\section{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION} 
\label{sect::results}

As an initial approach to characterize the ability of CADIS-$\Omega$, we chose two labyrinth test problems, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig::fwdflux}. These problems were chosen because of their wide coverage of generating anisotropy in the flux, which is described further in Section \ref{sect::future}. In these test problems, we performed an analog, CADIS, and CADIS-$\Omega$ calculation to optimize the response in the NaI detector. We compared the tally result, the relative uncertainty and the FOM of the response tally (f4) for all three calculations. To understand more about the differences in the performance between CADIS and CADIS-$\Omega$, we also present a comparison between the flux maps generated with the two methods. 

\begin{figure}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig::fwdflux} shows the forward fluxes for two representative problem geometries. Both geometries have a 10MeV point source at -75, 0, 0 with reflective outer boundary conditions, as well as a NaI detector behind the shield. Labyrinth I has a Li- doped polyethylene shield, and labyrinth II has a concrete shield. The geometry of labyrinth II has been known to be troublesome for CADIS in the literature [REFERENCE HERE], and labyrinth I was chosen due to its similar characteristics to labyrinth II.

    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./images/maze2_RE.png}
    \caption[]{\label{fig::tallyresponse} Tally response and relative uncertainties in tally in NaI detector for the labyrinth II problem. }
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The tally response and relative uncertainties for the NaI detector in labyrinth II are shown in Figure \ref{fig::tallyresponse}. CADIS-$\Omega$ has a lower relative error than CADIS for lower energy bins, but a higher relative error for higher energy bins. This is likely due to the degree of anisotropy of the flux near the detector for the different energy groups. Comparing the adjoint fluxes generated by CADIS and CADIS-$\Omega$ in group 26 (Figure \ref{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group26}), we see a strong effect. The majority of the group 26 neutrons that contribute to the detector response are reflected off of the back and bottom walls. Conversely, this effect is not as prominent in group 11, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group11}. This is likely due to the differences in the survival probability of a group 11 neutron compared to a group 26 neutron hitting the concrete wall. The group 11 neutrons are far more likely to return to the detector after hitting the concrete wall, resulting in a more locally-isotropic flux near the detector than in group 26. As a result, the group 11 CADIS-$\Omega$ adjoint fluxes more closely match the adjoint fluxes generated by CADIS. 

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{./images/maze2_adjoint_group26_adjusted.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{./images/maze2_myflux_group26_adjusted.png}
    \caption[]{\label{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group26}Adjoint flux generated by Denovo (left) and flux generated with forward-weighting (right) from CADIS-$\Omega$ for labyrinth II geometry.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

By adjusting the scales of the adjoint flux generated by CADIS and CADIS-$\Omega$, one can compare the biasing parameters for each problem. Figure \ref{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group26} adjusts the scales for labyrinth II in group 26, and Figure \ref{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group11} do so for group 11. It is quite noticeable that the majority of particles contributing to the NaI detector response in group 26 are reflected off of the right- and bottom- boundaries. This effect is also visible in figure \ref{fig::adjoint_fluxes_group11}, but is not as strong. As mentioned in Section \ref{subsect::theory}, the strength of this method is that it biases particles in the direction that they will actually be moving, rather than just towards the adjoint source.

    CADIS-$\Omega$   & 1282  &  248 & 354 & 94  \\  
	\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Note: these FOMs don't really make sense to me. Why is the analog problem so good in Labyrinth II but not in I? Is the material choice of the shield really that significant? That's the only thing I can come up with to explain this. I guess 100cm of concrete is possible for neutrons to make it through, but the poly has such a strong absorber in the Li that it makes it more difficult to penetrate. 


Table \ref{tab:FOMLabI} reports the results for the two problems with the FOM from the Monte Carlo simulation alone, and the adjusted FOM to incorporate the runtimes for deterministic transport. It is notable that even with the incorporated determinsitic transport calculations, the biased calculations perform significantly better than the analog problem for labyrinth I but not labyrinth II. We belive that this is due to the high absorption in the shield in labyrinth I, but less so for labyrinth II. For a simple problem with the fairly refined angular and spatial discretization we chose, the deterministic calculation time is not trivial. Because CADIS-$\Omega$ uses two deterministic transport calculations and not exclusively the adjoint solution as CADIS does, incorporating the increased time for the calculation is necessary for a fair comparison.

Table \ref{tab:FOMLabI} also shows that CADIS-$\Omega$ outperforms CADIS in labyrinth II, and performs more poorly than CADIS in labyrinth I. This is likely due to the large number of turns in labyrinth I. Any neutron that does make it through labyrinth I is likely to have scattered several times, rendering the flux throughout the maze channels to be relatively isotropic, reducing the effect of the method. However, this effect is not as significant in labyrinth II as it is in labyrinth I, which is likely why CADIS-$\Omega$ outperforms CADIS in this problem. More broadly, we expect that this method will perform well in problems with strong streaming paths and more poorly in problems with significant scattering effects.

\section{FUTURE WORK} 
\label{sect::future}
 
Section \ref{sect::results} showed that CADIS-$\Omega$ can outperform CADIS in a problem with a strong degree of angular anisotropy in the flux. However, there are a number of physical means by which angular anisotropy in the flux might occur. To further characterize the performance of CADIS-$\Omega$ and FW-CADIS-$\Omega$ throughout all of these problems, we have developed a suite of test problems that should help quantify the success of the method. The testing phase space identified in Table \ref{tab:testprobs} summarizes a sampling this problem space. As noted in Section \ref{sect::results}, problems where the direction of particles is important to the importance of a cell are where we anticipate the strength to lie in CADIS-$\Omega$. These problems aim to address all of the physical means by which the flux could become strongly anisotropic, and some have also have shown to be difficult for traditional FW/CADIS. 

 \begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Proposed Test Problem Coverage}
  \begin{tabular}{l|cccc}
    \toprule
    Problem Name & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Problem Coverage} \\
    \hline
    -- & Streaming Paths & Highly Scattering & Highly Heterogenous & Beam Problem \\
    \hline
    Streaming Channel   & X & & & X \\ 
    Metal Plate         & X & X & X &  \\
    Labyrinth Variants  & X & X & X &  \\ 
    Spherical Boat      & X & & X & X \\  
    Kobayashi Benchmark & X & X &  &  \\   
	\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:testprobs}
\end{table}

After FW/CADIS-$\Omega$ has been fully characterized throughout the phase space identified in Table \ref{tab:testprobs}, it will be tested with scaling problems. Scaling problems can be developed to target areas that FW/CADIS-$\Omega$ performed successfully in the characterization stage. We anticipate performing scaling studies on realistic, large-scale shielding problems, such as a dry cask storage bed. These scaling studies will help to inform users and developers how practical the method will be for use on a larger scale. 

As with the simple problems performed in Section \ref{sect::results}, the results of FW/CADIS-$\Omega$ will be compared to traditional FW/CADIS. The FOM, the tally uncertainty distribution, and the tally results will be indicators of the success of the -$\Omega$ methods.
